## In Progress

## Bugs

- [ ] Math conceal doesn't unconceal on cursor line
  - Concealed text using extmarks doesn't reveal when cursor moves to that line
  - Expected: cursor line shows original LaTeX commands (standard conceal behavior)
  - Likely related to extmarks not respecting `concealcursor` setting

## Features

- [ ] Citation conceal with bibliography lookup (blocked: waiting for anti-conceal in Neovim)
- [ ] Improved equation/environment numbering
- [ ] General environment numbering

## Ideas / Future Work

## Completed
